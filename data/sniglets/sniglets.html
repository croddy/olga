Sniglet = Any word which should be in the dictionary but isn't.

                     SNIGLETS ABOUT FOOD
                     -------------------

Cornextortion = When you go to the movie theatre and ask for a small popcorn,
             the guy behind the counter says, "for ONLY 25 cents more you can
             get a large popcorn". Moviegoers, watch out for this common
             tactic.
Crispthian = Any actor who is hired basically because his name helps sell
             the cereal, i.e. Captian Crunch. Snap, Crackle, and Pop from
             "Rice Krispies" are also crispthians. No one would hire them
             if their names were "Sputter", "Thutter", and "Whizz", would they?
Foodwinking = The practice of giving exotic names to otherwise mundane
             products. For example, "Salsa Rio flavored Doritos"
Milkdudes =  Any two milk duds fused together by accident.
Newtrons =   The magnetized particles that amazingly hold some fig newtons
             together.
Oatamatopoiea = The sound that the cereal "Captain Crunch" makes when you
             pour milk over it.
Snackmosphere = The 95% air inside bags of potato chips.
Sub-atomic toasticles = The little bits of toast that somehow always get
             stuck on the stick of butter.

                     SNIGLETS ABOUT MAPS
                     -------------------

Continentertinter = The person in a mapmaking company whose job is to
             decide what color a specific country is going to be.
Gapiana =    The little strip of land between the "You are now leaving"
             and "You are now entering" signs when you cross from one state
             into another.
Geosniglet = Any word that should be in the atlas but isn't.
Hawaska =    In an atlas, the rectangular box which contains Hawaii and
             Alaska and is located just off the coast of Arizona.

                     SNIGLETS ABOUT SHOPPING
                     -----------------------

Hereoglyph = A little stick figure on a mallmanac (see below) that tells you
             where you are in a mall because you can't tell by yourself
             because there is no face on it. (Often the words "You Are Here"
             occur at the bottom of the hereoglyph)
Mallmanac =  In a mall, the giant maze with blocks and numbers on it, otherwise
             known as the "Directory".

                     OTHER SNIGLETS
                     --------------

Delusions of Greendeur = Sometimes products will try to pander to you
             consciousness by claiming to be ozone friendly, environmentally-
             safe, ... no animal testing required. These products are called
             "Delusions of Greendeur". For example, Glad bags. It actually
             says on the back of the box, "Can be incenerated safely,
             providing more fuel value than wood or coal." What does this
             mean? You can actually heat your house, cook with Glad bags?
Discombebopulated = Whenever you are driving along and you can't find a
             house, and you have the address in your hand, and you can't
             find the address, so you turn the radio down. Somehow, this
             will help you find the house easier. If you ever find yourself
             doing this, then you are discombebopulated.
Exxonerated = Lets say that a CERTAIN oil tanker captain gets cranked up
             and wipes out the Alaskan coastline, but he only gets charged
             with criminal mischief, which kind of sounds like all he did
             was tape "kick me" signs to the backs of penguins. Well, then
             you can describe that captain as "Exxonerated".
Flushmania = When you go into a public restroom, and the whole place
             STINKS AS HELL, you flush ALL the toilets before doing
             what YOU have to do. (Related to Flushamnesia = When you
             forget to flush the toilet in a public restroom.)
Barfaroma =  The stink that eminates from a person immediately after he has
             thrown up.
